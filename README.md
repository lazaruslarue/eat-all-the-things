eat-all-the-things
==================
This project was a proof-of-concept for a recipe recommendation tool that I'd like to build in the future. 

I imagine an inventory of all items in my refrigerator and a list of recipes that I like which are used together to find the items I should buy at the grocery. That type of tool could be added to and autoshopping page to fill your basket with items you're likely to need/use.
